# HDTHe calorimetry v.1.0

The software generates predicted results of differential scanning calorimetry experiments for samples of palladium in a perforated capsule in an atmosphere containing a mixture of hydrogen isotopologues and helium. It can also be used to predict the results of absorption-desorption experiments at constant temperature and solid-phase isotopic ratio.
